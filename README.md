# Setup
First you should comment out everything what prints to terminal eg "exit" at exit, printf's for debugging etc
Then modify your main loop:
You should only read with readline and use your own prompt when you launch the program by yourself typing ./minihsell into the terminal, you can check it this way:


```c
	if (isatty(fileno(stdin)))
		shell->prompt = readline(shell->terminal_prompt);
```

Else if it is opened by another program/tester for example then use gnl as follows

```c
	char *line;
	line = get_next_line(fileno(stdin));
	shell->prompt = ft_strtrim(line, "\n");
	free(line);
```

So it should look like something like this:

```c
	if (isatty(fileno(stdin)))
		shell->prompt = readline(shell->terminal_prompt);
	else
	{
		char *line;
		line = get_next_line(fileno(stdin));
		shell->prompt = ft_strtrim(line, "\n");
		free(line);
	}
```

I think from this you pretty much can figure it out, it isn't a big change :)

# How To Install and Run
To install the script, copy and run following command:

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zstenger93/42_minishell_tester/master/install.sh)" 
```

The tester will be installed in the `$HOME/42_minishell_tester` directory.

After installation an alias `mstest` will be automaticly added in `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`

So that you can run the program in any directory (where your minishell is) by calling

```
mstest
```

---

# How To Launch The Tester

Do this if not using the `mstest` alias:
* Clone it to the root of your minishell
* cd to the tester's folder

## Options
Of course if using the `mstest` alias,
use that instead of `bash tester.sh`.
So a command should look like this:
`mstest help` or `mstest m` and etc.

When using the `mstest` alias, you don't
need to cd to the tester's folder.

Some options are not shown here,
run the help command to see them!

Print all options:
```bash
bash tester.sh help
```
Mandatory tests:
```bash
bash tester.sh m
```
Mandatory tests (with valgrind):
```bash
bash tester.sh vm
```
Tests for bonus from PDF:
```bash
bash tester.sh b
```
Tests both mandatory and bonus:
```bash
bash tester.sh a
```

---

# Updates
Tests without environment now are updated, separated and can be run with:

```bash
bash tester.sh ne
```

Now they should be working better, still don't trust it 100% and do test yourself as well to understand.
It's a bit tricky to do test's well in this case because if you run `env -i bash` it disables only partially.
It will still have most things, but if you do `unset PATH` afterwards, will see the difference.
Also this part is pretty much what you aren't required to handle.
The main point is to not to crash/segfault when you launch without environment.

# Disclaimer

DO NOT FAIL SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY AREN'T PASSING ALL TESTS!

NEITHER LET THEM PASS JUST BECAUSE THEY DO, CHECK THE CODE WELL!

DO YOUR OWN TESTING. TRY TO BREAK IT! ^^

HAVE FUN WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL MINISHELL

Don't trust 100% the leak check, try it yourself as well and the linked tester below
Try to write your own test first and don't just run a tester mindlessly
You don't have to pass all the cases in this tester
If you want to check leaks outside of your manual checking:

[This is also a good one to check valgrind](https://github.com/thallard/minishell_tester)
A bit more time to set it up, but worth it
The first time if you run the tester above and expect a lot of errors
Then redirect each of the output from stdin and strerror to a file otherwise you won't be able see all of the errors

Even though the required changes have been made to your proram, it might still going to throw you only KO STD_OUT.
This is because readline version. (then you probably have the older version where it isn't checking where does the input coming from(the tester or you))

If a test just hanging in infinite loop, you can use the link to go there and comment it out in the test file until you fix it.

Later on I might make changes so you can run test for each part like cd, echo, pipes, redirs etc.. as well
Or if someone takes on the challenge, you are welcome to do so.

Feel free to ask on slack if you have a question
Or open a pull request if you would like to add more tests
Looking for people who would like to add more tests to the bonus part, because we haven't done it
